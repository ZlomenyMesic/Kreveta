// to help move ordering, we use a few different history heuristics.
// the idea of these is that we save moves that proved to be good
// or bad in the past, idenependently of the position. for instance,
// if we noticed that sacrificing our rook two moves ago was a terrible
// move, we can usually be assured that doing the same two pawn pushes
// later would be the same exact blunder.

    // idea taken from Chess Programming Wiki:
    // the main disadvantage of the history heuristic is that it tends to
    // bias towards moves, which appear more frequently. there might be
    // a move that turned out to be very good, but doesn't occur that
    // often and thus, doesn't get a very large score. for this reason,
    // use the so-called relative history heuristic, which alongside with
    // the history scores also stores the number of times a move has been
    // visited (ButterflyScores). when retrieving the quiet score, it is
    // then divided by this number to get the average.
